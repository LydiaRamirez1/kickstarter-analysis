# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview
-Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
### Purpose
-The purpose of this analysis is to see how the data outcomes vary based on different factors and if there are any trends that lead to the multiple outcomes.
## Analysis and Challenges
-This is the data set being used in this project.

-The main portion of data that I focused on was the parent category theater to analyze the different outcomes based on that selected data.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
-This line chart displays the data for theather outcomes based on launch date. According to the chart the majority of the outcomes were successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
-This line chart displays data for outcomes based on goals. According to the chart the majority of the outcomes were opposite except for during the goal of $15,000-$19,999 where they are the same.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- I had difficulties making the Ouctomes Based on Goals data into a pivot table. Thus causing me to struggle with creating the required line chart of the data.However I was able to figure out how to create the line chart without having to make a pivot table.
## Results 
- Two conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date data are that the majority of the outcomes each month were successful, with the highest success rate being at the end of April/ beginning of May. 
- I can conclude that the Outcomes based on Goals data has opposite outcome rates of success and failure, the data mirrors itself on the line chart. There were no canceled outcomes in this data.
- Some limitations of this dataset include the live outcomes and the canceled outcomes.
- Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create would be a pie chart and a bar chart. Pie charts are specifically great for displaying different percentages within a data set.
